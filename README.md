# Fullstack Grocery Store POS

- [Fullstack Grocery Store POS](#fullstack-grocery-store-pos)
- [Database Design](#database-design)


A ready to use full stack grocery store web application I made from scratch. Uses HTML/CSS/Bootstrap as the frontend, Python as the backend, and sqlite for the database.

# Database Design
The database is using SQLite and also SQLite3 library in python. For viewing, managing, and editing the database it was mostly done within the free VSCode extension SQLite3 Editor. I highly HIGHLY recommend this extension. Link 👇🏽
